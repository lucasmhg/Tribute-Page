        Summary of the epic life of Leonidas I
      </h2>
      <p id='tribute-info'>Leonidas I, or Λεωνίδας in Greek, was born circa 540 B.C.E. He was a warrior-king of Sparta, famous for his leadership of the 300 Spartans who fought and died in the face of insurmountable odds in the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.E. during the invasion of Greece by the Persians.<br>
<br>
Myth:<br>
<br>
Leonidas is said to have met the great and vast armies of Persia at Thermopylae Pass, where he sent 4,000 regular soldiers (hoplites) and 300 elite soldiers to fight. The Greek historian Herodotus wrote that the Persian Army had around seven million soldiers which "drank entire rivers empty". Packed tightly between the high cliffs of the pass, the Spartans held their position and were successful under unrelenting pressure from the Persians. However, a double-agent posing as a Spartan warrior is said to have passed Leonidas' battle plans to the Persians, allowing them to overtake the Spartans. Leonidas fell in this final stand, and died a great hero's death.<br>
<br>
History:<br>
<br>
Although sources disagree, modern historians believe the Spartans and Athenians had around 7,000 soldiers and the Persians around <b>300,000 soldiers</b>. As the myth became popular, these numbers may have been manipulated to emphasize the heroism of Leonidas and his men.<br>
